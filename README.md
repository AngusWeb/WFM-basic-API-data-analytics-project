Project Structure Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a data analysis project. Below is a breakdown of the key components and their locations within the project:

API Interaction Code: The logic for interacting with the API is encapsulated in the datawfm.py file. This script is responsible for fetching data from the API and preparing it for analysis.

Data Manipulation and Visualization: The datapandasall.py file contains the code for data manipulation, graphing, and tabulation using Pandas. This script transforms the raw data into insightful visualizations and tables.

Graphs: The visual output of the project, including all the graphs that were found to be useful, can be viewed in this image: [Graphs Image](https://i.imgur.com/pyggvAj.png). These graphs represent the analyzed data in a visual format, making it easier to understand and interpret the findings.

Data Extraction Scripts: Separate scripts were utilized to extract specific data from the dataframe, which was then used in API requests. These scripts are part of the data preprocessing steps that facilitate the analysis.

Failed Graph Attempts: It's worth noting that the project also includes several attempts at graphing that did not yield the expected results. These attempts are part of the iterative process of data analysis and visualization, showcasing the trial and error involved in finding the most effective ways to represent the data.
