the API interaction code is located in the file named datawfm.py, while the data manipulation, graphing, and tabulation with Pandas are handled in datapandasall.py. You can view all the graphs I found useful in this image: https://i.imgur.com/pyggvAj.png. Additionally, I used separate scripts to extract data from the dataframe for API requests, and there were several attempts at graphing that didn't work out as planned.
